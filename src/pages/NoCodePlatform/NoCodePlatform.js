                              <p>The most important aspect of art for both artists and collectors is for the value to be unique. Which is where our Anti-Rip Protocol kicks into action as decentralized security built-in to NFTs we mint.</p>

                                <p>Just like Greco in Oceans 13, our platform will crawl and index all the events emitted by major marketplaces, while determining if any price movement is either organic or manufactured.</p>

                                    <p>When we identify a whale or institution buying an NFT in a nondescript way, we then take a deeper look at that collection so that we beat the FOMO before anyone else.</p>

                                        <h6 className="feature-title">Recoverability</h6>
                                        <p>When a decentralized governance protocol that includes collectors and the artist decide democratically, we initiate doomsday protocol to recover an NFT completely.</p>

                                        <h6 className="feature-title">Dupe Alert</h6>
                                        <p>Think of Google on steroids for the NFT universe. As soon as any one of your NFTs finds itself a dopple ganger in any marketplace, you will be the first to know, to take action in anyway you see fit.</p>
